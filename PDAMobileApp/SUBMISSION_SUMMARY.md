## 🤖 AI Agent Description

### **What Our AI Agent Does**

We built a **consent-native Personal Data Agent (PDA) system** that demonstrates the future of privacy-first AI. Our solution consists of two intelligent agents working together:

#### **📥 Inbox Agent (Email Intelligence)**
- **Gmail Integration:** Secure OAuth2 connection with consent-validated access
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Automatically analyzes emails for summaries, action items, key topics, and sentiment
- **Smart Content Generation:** Creates professional replies, proposals, and responses using AI
- **Batch Processing:** Select multiple emails for bulk analysis and categorization
- **Real-time Insights:** Provides instant intelligence about your inbox

#### **📅 Schedule Agent (Calendar Intelligence)**  
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Secure OAuth2 connection with encrypted token storage
- **AI-Powered Scheduling:** Suggests optimal meeting times based on learned patterns
- **Smart Event Creation:** AI can auto-schedule events with confidence scoring
- **Pattern Learning:** Analyzes your scheduling habits and preferences
- **Conflict Detection:** Identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts automatically

#### **📱 Mobile-First Experience**
- **React Native App:** Beautiful, modern interface for both agents
- **Real-time Sync:** Pull-to-refresh and live updates
- **Consent Management:** Clear visibility into what data is being accessed
- **Cross-Agent Communication:** Agents can work together (email → calendar events)

## 🔧 Services/APIs/Tools Used

### **Core Technologies:**
- **FastAPI** - Backend server for both agents
- **React Native** - Mobile app with TypeScript
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** - AI analysis and content generation
- **Google APIs** - Gmail and Calendar OAuth2 integration

### **Security & Privacy:**
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - All sensitive data encrypted
- **HMAC-SHA256** - Cryptographic consent token signing
- **OAuth2** - Secure authentication flows
- **AsyncStorage** - Secure local token storage

### **AI/ML Features:**
- **Natural Language Processing** - Email content analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Email priority and tone detection
- **Pattern Recognition** - Learning user scheduling preferences
- **Content Generation** - Smart replies and proposals

### **Development Tools:**
- **Python 3.9+** - Backend development
- **Node.js/Expo** - Mobile app development
- **Git** - Version control
- **ngrok** - Development tunneling

## 🌟 What Makes Our Solution Unique

### **1. Consent-Native Architecture**
- **Every action requires cryptographically signed consent tokens**
- **No data access without explicit user permission**
- **Scope-limited access (read vs write permissions)**
- **User can revoke access at any time**

### **2. Privacy-First Design**
- **All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256-GCM**
- **No plaintext storage of OAuth tokens**
- **End-to-end encryption of user data**
- **No data retention beyond active sessions**

### **3. Modular Agent System**
- **Independent agents that can communicate**
- **Easy to extend and add new agents**
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- **Reusable consent and encryption modules**

### **4. Real-World Utility**
- **Solves actual problems (email management, scheduling)**
- **Mobile-first design for real usage**
- **AI that actually helps, not just demos**
- **Production-ready code quality**

### **5. Innovative Features**
- **AI-powered meeting time suggestions**
- **Smart email reply generation**
- **Cross-agent communication (email → calendar)**
- **Pattern learning and preference optimization**

## 🚀 What We Would Build Next

### **Short-term (1-2 months):**
- **Contact Sync Agent** - Automatically sync contacts between email and calendar
- **Document Processing Agent** - Extract and analyze attachments
- **Notification Agent** - Smart notification management across services
- **Voice Integration** - Voice commands for agent operations

### **Medium-term (3-6 months):**
- **Multi-Platform Support** - Outlook, Apple Mail, other calendar services
- **Team Collaboration** - Multi-user consent and sharing
- **Advanced AI Features** - Meeting summarization, action item tracking
- **Workflow Automation** - Complex multi-step processes

### **Long-term (6+ months):**
- **Agent Marketplace** - Third-party agents with consent validation
- **Federated Learning** - Privacy-preserving AI model training
- **Blockchain Integration** - Immutable consent audit trails
- **Enterprise Features** - SSO, compliance, admin controls

## 🔐 Technical Implementation Highlights

### **Consent Protocol:**
```python
# Every action requires consent validation
def validate_token(token_str: str, expected_scope: ConsentScope):
    # Cryptographic signature verification
    # Scope validation
    # Expiration checking
    # Revocation checking
```

### **Encryption:**
```python
# All sensitive data encrypted
def encrypt_data(plaintext: str, key_hex: str) -> EncryptedPayload:
    # AES-256-GCM encryption
    # Secure IV generation
    # Authentication tag
```

### **Agent Communication:**
```typescript
// Cross-agent messaging with consent
interface AgentMessage {
  from_agent: string;
  to_agent: string;
  user_id: string;
  message_type: string;
  payload: any;
  trust_link?: string;
}
```
