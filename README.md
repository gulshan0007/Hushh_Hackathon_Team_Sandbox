  - Tokens are stored in `AsyncStorage` and used for all API calls.
- **API Communication:**
  - All sensitive operations (fetching events/emails, creating events, generating AI content) are performed via backend endpoints, with tokens validated on every call.
  - The app never accesses Google APIs directly‚Äîeverything is routed through the consent-protocol backend for privacy and auditability.
- **AI Features:**
  - AI-powered features (suggestions, insights, smart replies, content generation) are powered by backend endpoints that use OpenAI (ChatGPT) and custom logic.

- üîê Issue & verify **cryptographically signed consent tokens**
- üîÅ Delegate trust across **agent-to-agent (A2A) links**
- üóÑÔ∏è Store & retrieve **AES-encrypted personal data**
- ü§ñ Operate within well-scoped, revocable, user-issued permissions

Inspired by biology (operons), economics (trust-based contracts), and real-world privacy laws.
