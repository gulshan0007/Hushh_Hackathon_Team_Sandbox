## 🤖 AI Agent Description

We built a **consent-native Personal Data Agent (PDA) system** with two intelligent agents that demonstrate the future of privacy-first AI:

### 🗓️ **Schedule Agent (Calendar Intelligence)**
- **Purpose:** AI-powered calendar management with pattern learning and smart scheduling
- **Consent Scopes:** `calendar.read`, `calendar.write`
- **Key Features:**
  - Google Calendar OAuth2 integration with encrypted token storage
  - AI-powered meeting time suggestions based on learned user patterns
  - Automatic conflict detection and resolution
  - Smart event creation with confidence scoring
  - Real-time calendar synchronization with consent validation

### 📥 **Inbox Agent (Email Intelligence)**
- **Purpose:** Gmail inbox analysis and AI-powered insights generation
- **Consent Scopes:** `gmail.read`, `gmail.write`, `AI_ANALYZE`, `DOCUMENT_PROCESS`
- **Key Features:**
  - Gmail OAuth2 integration with privacy-preserving operations
  - AI-powered email analysis (summarization, sentiment, action items)
  - Smart reply generation using GPT-4
  - Professional content generation (proposals, responses, analyses)
  - Batch email processing and categorization

### 📱 **Mobile-First Experience**
- **React Native App** serving as frontend for both agents
- **Real-world OAuth2 consent flows** demonstrating privacy controls
- **Cross-agent communication** (email → calendar events)
- **Modern, animated UI** with clear feedback and error handling
